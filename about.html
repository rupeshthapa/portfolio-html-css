                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>I hold a BSc in Computing with a focus on Software Engineering from NAMI College, 
                    Kathmandu affiliated with University of Northampton. During my academic journey, 
                    I have honed my skills in developing both personal and professional projects across 
                    multiple platforms. My internship at Midas Technologies (Delphi) allowed me to further
                    immerse myself in software development processes and gain real-world exposure. The 
                    foundation laid by my education and practical experience has provided me with the 
                    capability to develop innovative solutions using modern technologies.</p>
